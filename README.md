## Idea
Not so long ago, i made a similar project called <a href="https://github.com/TomazMPP/what-time-is-it" target="_blank">What Time is It?</a>, on that project the layout of the page would change based on the time (morning/afternoon/evening) and on the weather (snow/rain). So, today i was thinking what to work on, and since i really enjoyed working with the API on that project, i had the idea of making this small project that you can check the weather from any city around the world (ENG typing)

## What did i learn new with this project?
* Although the CSS seems the same from the CrazyRaffle repository, i feel like i improved a lot my CSS skills on this repository. I also put to work the things i learned doing the CrazyRaffle repository.
